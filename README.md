   Implement and compare the running times of the following algorithms
   on randomly generated arrays: (a) Insertion sort, (b) Merge sort (take 1),
   (c) Merge sort (take 2), (d) Merge sort (take 3).
   Do not run more than one algorithm in each trial.
   For Insertion sort, if the running time exceeds 2 min, write the time as infinity.
   For Merge sort, in each trial, run only one algorithm, for one value of n, 100 times
   in a loop, and taking the average time.
   Try the following values of n: 8M, 16M, 32M, 64M, ..., until you get out of memory exception.
